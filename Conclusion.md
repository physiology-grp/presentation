# Salutogenic Interventions
Objective: In the same way, based on this theory some authors suggest that salutogenic strategies should be produced to:
- Facilitate communities to create shared life visions and to be part of decision making
- Develop shared mental models about the change process and desired outcomes
- Enable communities to identify life demands (e.g. stressors, challenges)
- General resistance resource that need to be balanced as well as life opportunities (e.g. assets, learning situations) that stimulate health development
- To improve self-knowledge and to identity family and community roles.

# Types of interventions
4 types of interventions are included
## 1. Individual interventions
Focus on health education activities counselling and psychotherapeutic methodologies from different approaches (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Psychodynamic Occupational Therapy). These were developed, among others, in relation to physical morbidity (HIV, Mental Health and perceived quality of life and health)

## 2. Group Interventions
Developed in group with similar health problems. Interventions include health education activities and different types of psycho-therapy. These focused on different health topics, including the management of chronic diseases, mental health and subjective well being, as well as social dimensions such as social trust, social capital and social compromise.

## 3. Mixed Interventions
Incorporate combined action at individual and group level. 'Mixed interventions' presented a wide range of topics linked to management of chronic pan, functional capacity improvement, psychosomatic disorders.

## 4. Intersectional Interventions
Carried out by collaborator form two ro more different background areas (multidisciplinary teams) aiming to intervene not only on people and communities but also within the environment in which the health problem take place.

These approaches were focused in urban development, self care programs, social prescription, social participation, development of public policies and basic services

# Health Outcomes of Salutogenic Interventions
Although a number of different limitations were reported, the specific results of each type of intervention were:

## 1. Individual Interventions led to:
- Decrease in HIV rates
- Increase in perception of quality of life
- Reduction in eating disorders
- Reduction in psychopathological symptomatology
## 2. Group Interventions showed Improvements  in different fields, such as:
- Improvement in perceived health
- Improvement functional capacity
- Reduction in stress symptomatology
## 3. Mixed Interventions indicated progression linked to a:
- Reduction in pain related symptomatology
- Increase of functional capacity
- Higher psychological, physical and social well being
## 4. Intersectional Interventions derived to:
- Decrease in preventable mortality for diabetes mellitus, influenza, heart disease and infant mortality

# Conclusions
Findings support the existence of positive health effects of salutogenic approaches. Important methodological limitation were identifies such as biases in the selection of participants and sample sizes. Studies need to be conducted with improved monitoring and evaluation designs a more robust theoretical framework and tools to evaluate the salutogenic contents are needed
