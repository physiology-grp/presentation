## INTRODUCTION
"Instead of focusing solely on what's wrong, the salutogenic approach to student wellness emphasizes identifying and nurturing what's right within individuals and their environments."

As we embark on our journey through the captivating world of medicine, it is crucial for us to not only understand the intricacies of diagnosing and treating aliments but also to recognize that well-being plays a pivotal role in the lives of both patients and health care professionals. We are delighted to introduce a concept that resonates deeply with the well-being of students like us: THE SALUTOGENIC APPROACH TO STUDENT WELLNESS.

Throughout this presentation, we will unravel the core principles of salutogenesis, delving into its founder's vision and the remarkable "Sense of Coherence" model. We will explore how this approach can revolutionize the way we approach student wellness, promoting not only physical health but also mental resilience and meaningful connections. By understanding how personal, social, and material resources contribute to our well-being, we can enhance our ability to navigate the challenges that lie ahead.

Salutogenesis emphasizes on understanding the source of health, resilience and the resources that enable individuals to maintain sense of coherence & thriving. As aspiring doctors, we are not only tasked with healing the body but also with nurturing the holistic well-being of our patients. By embracing the salutogenic approach to student wellness, we take a step closer to embodying the ideals of compassionate and holistic care that define the medical profession.

Our Presentation’s aim is to delve into the realm of student wellness and illuminate how the salutogenic approach can serve as a guiding light in enhancing our well-being. This approach helps in understanding of the factors that empower us as a student to flourish academically, emotionally and socially. By the end, we will grasp how the principles of salutogenesis can illuminate a path towards a more resilient, balances, and thriving student life.
