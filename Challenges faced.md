## Challenges Faced
The present education system poses multiple challenges to the implementation of a salutogenic approach
- Resistance to change - Students feel that changing their lifestyle or approach to life or studying may adversely affect the outcome. Consequently they are dragged into the same unhealthy process with no self care.
- Mental Models - With salutogenesis being a new model of approach, there is little to no ulterior model to look upto.
- Stressors - The inability to pin point the stressors in life leads to partial assessment of situation and consequently a holistic approach is not applied.
- Manageability - The sub standard management of resources lead to poor utilization of time which in turn leads to stress and poor mental health.
- Opportunities - The lack of opportunities present for the youth to explore their niche of action leads to poor career choices and hence they are dragged into multiple failures and lose faith.
