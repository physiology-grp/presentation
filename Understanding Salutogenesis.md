# SALUTOGENESIS
"Salutogenesis" is a term coined by Aaron Antonovsky, a renowned Israeli-American sociologist and medical sociologist. This term is a fusion of two Latin words: "salus," which means health, and "genesis," which means origin or creation. Essentially, salutogenesis refers to the study and exploration of the origins of health and well-being.

Aaron Antonovsky, born in 1923, was deeply intrigued by the question of why some individuals and communities remain healthy despite facing challenging circumstances. He was dissatisfied with the conventional focus on illness and disease, and he sought to understand what factors contribute to people's ability to not just survive, but thrive.

Antonovsky introduced the ground-breaking concept of the "Sense of Coherence" (SOC) model. This model comprises three key components: comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. According to Antonovsky, individuals who possess a strong sense of coherence are better equipped to navigate stressors and maintain well-being.

In a world where health is often seen as the absence of illness, Antonovsky's salutogenic perspective shifted the conversation towards actively understanding the sources of health, resilience, and the factors that help us lead meaningful lives. His pioneering work has left a lasting impact on fields such as medicine, psychology, and public health, inspiring researchers and practitioners to explore wellness in a new light â€“ not merely as the absence of disease, but as a dynamic and multifaceted state of thriving.

# SENSE OF COHERENCE
The "Sense of Coherence" (SOC) is like a superhero trio for our well-being. Imagine it as a three-part power that helps us stay strong and healthy.

1. Comprehensibility: This is about making sense of things around us. It's like having a map to navigate through life's twists and turns. When we understand what's happening and why, we feel more in control. It's like solving a puzzle and knowing where the pieces fit.
2. Manageability: Life throws challenges at us, but with manageability, we're like expert problem solvers. It's the ability to handle stress and bounce back. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, we can break down problems into smaller parts and tackle them one by one.
3. Meaningfulness: Imagine finding a treasure that gives you a sense of purpose. That's meaningfulness. When we have goals, passions, and things that matter to us, life feels more fulfilling. It's like having a compass that guides us and keeps us motivated.

So, together, comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness make up the Sense of Coherence. When we have a strong SOC, it's like having a shield that protects our well-being, helping us navigate challenges and stay healthy.
