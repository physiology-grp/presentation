# Meaningful engagement
## Clinical survive
It is not just about the individual. It is also about the environment the individual lives and learns in. Ths is especially true as we consider ways to further support our student's health and well being. We know there is and will always be demand for clinical services provided by our health and counselling centers. Clinical service is most important factor for salutogenic approach for student well being

## Campus environment
By seeking to create campus environment and cultures that actively support student health and well being, a salutogenic approach make specific resistance resources available to student thereby enabling a strengthened sense of coherence. By embedding health into campus culture, we can more engage our campus, our student, our senior, our colleagues to build a truly salutogenic campus environment.

## Extracurricular activities
For development, extracurricular activities are also most important in student life. Student are pressurized during exams and they have performance pressure too of gaining good grades. In such conditions, there is a need for some extra activities like cultural activities, sports, competition and lot more.
