# Ways to overcome challenges.
- Creating awareness - Multiple camps or workshops should be arranged to create awareness among students to a better and healthier approach to life.
- Involving stakeholders - The authorities like the Principle, Head of Departments,etc must be instructed to teach students about mental well being. Making salutogenesis a part of the curriculum can help students incorporate it in their life easily
- Prioritizing resources - Resourcefulness is necessary for the students to turn to them at the time of need. Showing models of positive outcome to students can help them in applying salutogenic principles in life.
