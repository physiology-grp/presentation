# Implementation of salutogenic approach
For implementation of salutogenic approach to the student wellness, not only educational institutions but also every club, social media, sport training institutes etc should take steps:

## 1. Education Through Sports *(ETS method)*
The ETS methodology intends exclusively to use sport as educational tool. The components such as theoretical education, mentorship, skills, training reflection and intervention is not directly related to sport, but remain very important and have to be taken into consideration when sport is used for an educational purpose. All of these elements play a significant role in the learning process. They actually become the central focus which stimulates development and social transformation, rather than the sport program itself.

## 2. Education For Sports *(EFS method)*
The main aim of EFS method is to develop competences in term of sport performance. Education for Sport addresses the improvement of skills related to the sport itself. Thus, its purpose is only to serve the development of individual competences to improve physical performances.

## 3. Education By Sports *(EBS method)*
The aim of EBS method is to combine the sporting goals with the wellbeing of society, so its educational goals are at second plan. It uses sport exercise and physical activity to work towards social causes such as raising awareness about health and wellbeing.

EX: The "Sport for all" movements are very close to this approach. By playing different sport, it is expected that people learn more about healthy lifestyles in this way raise awareness about the mentioned use.

## 4. Implementation of salutogenic approach in schools
Schools should organize many wellness program to take charge of their students' stress. These programs are effective and can help students better cope with the world around them.

a) Handling stress in school requires leadership and action. School have to know how much stress students are under and how they are coping.

b) School authority should give tope priority to their students' experience; ensure their school day enriches their education.

c) School authority should maximize their wellness program schedule to give benefits to the entire school community.

## 5. Implementation of salutogenic approach in universities; higher studies

A whole university approach is also understood to be underpinned by health promotion values and to involve the following strategies:

- Balancing a pathogenic focus on addressing needs and problems with a salutogenic focus on harnessing a university's strengths, assets and potentials i order to support the well-being and flourishing of students, staff and the wider community.
- Securing 'top-down' leadership whilst also engaging 'bottom-up' stakeholder engagement and participation.

## 6. Collaboration among students, teacher, parents, support staff
Collaboration improves the way how one's team works together and solves problems. Through listening and learning from seniors, teachers, parents, one can help each other reach their goals in a tension free way
- ***Teachers' role:*** Teachers should teach their students how to maintain good health by decreasing stress or by physical exercise, not by taking chemicals, medicines. Teachers should collaborate by for example sharing experiences and materials, discussing educational literature, and collegial observation.
- ***Parents' role:*** Parents who deal with stress in unhealthy ways risk passing those behaviors on to their children. Alternatively, parents who cope with stress in healthy ways can not only promote better adjustment and happiness for themselves but also promote the formation of critically important habits and skills in children.
- ***Senior's role:*** Engaging their juniors in regular physical activity is one of the best things senior can do for stress management of juniors. Seniors also can take a session of entertainment (singing, dancing, making jokes, recitation etc.) for stress relies of their juniors and they also help in study during juniors' exam time - this relieves juniors exam time stress very much.
